# Wizard

Ready to get started in no time? Run these commands first, then visit our [Install Wizard](http://localhost:4000/) to create your `.env` file. It's a breeze!

```bash
# Change directory to installation project
cd install

# Make sure you have NVM set up on your machine in order to ensure the project is running on the correct version of Node.js.
nvm install

# Install packages
npm install

# Run the install wizard and visit: http://localhost:4000/
npm run start
```

Don't forget to change directory back to the project's path once you are done with the setup, and place the generated configuration from the Install Wizard into `.env`.
