# Branding

To configure the brand name for your application, set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_BRAND_NAME` variable in your `.env` file. This variable will be used throughout the application to personalize the user experience with your brand's name. For example:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_BRAND_NAME=Bildap
```

Replace `Bildap` with the desired name of your brand. This will ensure that all references to the brand within the application are consistent and easily manageable.
